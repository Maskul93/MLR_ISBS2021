# An Automated Method for the Estimate of the Vertical Jump Power through Inertial Measurement Units.

The repository has been created to show the core processing of what have been made for the ISBS2021 proceeding entitled *An Automated Method for the Estimate of the Vertical Jump Power through Inertial Measurement Units*. 

The idea was to combine both **antropometric** and **time-frequency features**. Another example of such approach was presented of the ISB2021 conference, even though involving a different device (a smartphone) with a different outcome (jump height). If interested, you can find more information at the corresponding repo: <a href="https://github.com/Maskul93/MLR_ISB2021">LINK</a>.

In this repository, you will find an *interactive* Python Notebook. If you are familiar with what such an environment is, just clone the repository and feel free to play with the code. If not, you can either install <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (and <a href = "https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>) on your device, or clone it directly on your Google Drive cloud storage via <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a>. Enjoy!
